# nvim-setup
All my configurations for neovim and all the plugins I use

if confused, start with init.vim. All files are linked here. The general folder contains
nvim-wide default configurations. The plug-config folder contains all configuration
for plugins. All plugins were connected using vim-plug (in the vim-plug folder).
